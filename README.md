  Welcome to XBMC Home Theater Software!
</h1>

XBMC4Xbox is a free and open source media player software made solely for the first-generation Xbox video-game console. The software was forked from the XBMC project (now known as Kodi and formerly known as Xbox Media Player) after XBMC removed support for the Xbox console. Other than the audio / video playback and media center functionality, XBMC4Xbox also has the ability to catalog and launch original Xbox games, and homebrew applications such as console emulators from the Xbox's built-in harddrive. 

## Give your media the love it deserves
XBMC is your all-in-one solution for enjoying almost all popular audio, video, and gaming formats. Whether you're streaming multimedia from anywhere in your home or directly from the internet, XBMC handles it effortlessly, supporting virtually any protocol available.

Simply point XBMC to your media or game collection, and watch as it **magically scans and creates a personalized library** complete with box covers, descriptions, and fanart. XBMC isn't just for movies and music; it also offers robust support for video games, including emulators and retro games. Turn your Xbox into the ultimate multimedia and gaming hub, complete with playlist and slideshow features, weather forecasts, audio visualizations, and more. Once installed, your Xbox will become a fully functional multimedia jukebox and gaming console all in one.

## Getting Started
XBMC4Xbox is the continuation of the popular [Kodi fork](https://www.xbmc4xbox.org.uk/), specifically developed for the Original Xbox (2001). This project is a revitalized fork of the original XBMC4Xbox, with the primary goal of aligning it with the latest advancements in Kodi software. Our main mission is to keep the GUILIB updated to match Kodi, ensuring that the newest skins can be seamlessly backported. By doing so, we aim to bring the best of modern Kodi features to the classic Xbox platform, preserving its legacy while enhancing its functionality.

## How to Contribute
XBMC is created by users for users and **we welcome every contribution**. There are no highly paid developers or poorly paid support personnel on the phones ready to take your call. There are only users who have seen a problem and done their best to fix it. This means XBMC will always need the contributions of users like you. How can you get involved?

* **Coding:** Developers can help XBMC by **[fixing a bug](https://github.com/antonic901/xbmc4xbox-redux/issues)**, adding new features, making our technology smaller and faster and making development easier for others. XBMC's codebase consists mainly of C++ with small parts written in a variety of coding languages. Our add-ons mainly consist of python and XML.

The #1 priority is always answering questions in our **[support forums](https://discord.com/channels/770816616937160745/1050581194401652736)**. Everyday new people discover XBMC, and everyday they are virtually guaranteed to have questions.

## Building
XBMC is coded using official XDK (Xbox Development Kit).

## Requirements
 - PC or [Virtual Machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/) with Windows XP SP3
 - Microsoft Visual C++ 2003 with [XDK (Xbox Development Kit)](https://xbox.fandom.com/wiki/Xbox_Development_Kit)

Unfortunately I can't share any of those software because both Microsoft Visual Studio C++ 2003 and Xbox Development Kit are Microsot's property. But on this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN2t-D0cj48) you can find a great tutorial from MVG on how to convert retail consoles to debug kits. I suggest you to use CerBios with flag "debug = enabled" in cerbios.ini file. You then just need to find DEBUG Dash which you will copy to your Xbox and you are ready to go.

## How to build
 - Clone this repository
 - Open Build.bat
 - Both times choose option 1 and hit enter
 - After build is finished, inside BUILD folder you will have XBMC4Xbox ready to be installed on Xbox
